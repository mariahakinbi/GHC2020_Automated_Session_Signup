Getting Started:
1. you'll need to download the firefox driver here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers and add it to your PATH (/usr/bin OR /usr/local/bin)
OR you can do "brew install geckodriver" in the terminal
< insert google picture of instructions>

2. I ran into an issue on my mac. If you have a mac and the setup_test.py doesnt run, then you'll need to go to the location in the PATH and right-click the driver then select " open in terminal " then run  setup_test.py by going to the command line and navigating to the folder that has this repo then type "python setup_test.py"
